# Setting the Privacy Budget in DP

This repository contains code to implement the framework described in "Prior-itizing Privacy: A Bayesian Approach to Setting the Privacy Budget in Differential Privacy" (Kazan and Reiter, 2024). The file `find_eps.R` provides a function that returns the recommended $\varepsilon$ for an input risk profile, $r^*(p_i,q_i)$. The file `examples.pdf` (and the corresponding code, `examples.Rmd`) provides examples of the function's use. The file `code_for_paper.R` contains code to reproduce all figures in the paper, which can also be found in the `Figures` folder.

This research was supported by NSF grant SES-2217456.
