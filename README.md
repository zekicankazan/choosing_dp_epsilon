# Setting the Privacy Budget in DP

This repository contains code to implement the framework described in "Prior-itizing Privacy: A Bayesian Approach to Setting the Privacy Budget in Differential Privacy" (Kazan and Reiter, 2023). The file `find_eps.R` provides a function that returns the recommended $\varepsilon$ for an input risk profile, $r^*(p_i,q_i)$. The file `examples.pdf` (and the corresponding code, `examples.Rmd`) provides examples of the function's implementation.

This research was supported by NSF grant SES-221745.
